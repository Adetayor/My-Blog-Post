    <h2>All About AI</h2>
  
    <p class="headline"> Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
      Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.</p>
  
      <p>As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use it. Often, 
        what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized 
        hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No single programming language is synonymous with AI, 
        but Python, R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.</p>
      
      <p>AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: 
        advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech 
        (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), 
        and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).</p>
      
      
      <blockquote class="quote">"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of humans or 
        animals. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. AI will create more Jobs than we ever imagined."

      <h3>Cognitive skills AI Programming Focuses on</h3>
      
        <p> AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states</p>
      
        <p>New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, images, music and other media.</p>
      
      <h4>Learning</h4>
      
      This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn it into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices 
      with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.
      
      <h4>Reasoning</h4>
      
      This focuses on choosing the right algorithm to reach a desired outcome.
      
      <h4>Self-correction</h4>
      
      This aspect of AI programming is designed to continually fine-tune algorithms and ensure they provide the most accurate results possible.
      
      <h4>Creativity</h4>
      
      This aspect of AI uses neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods and other AI techniques to generate new images, new text, new music and new ideas.
      
      <h3>Differences between AI, machine learning and deep learning</h3>
      
      <p>AI, machine learning and deep learning are common terms in enterprise IT and sometimes used interchangeably, especially by companies in their marketing materials. But there are distinctions. 
        The term AI, coined in the 1950s, refers to the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It covers an ever-changing set of capabilities as new technologies are developed. Technologies 
        that come under the umbrella of AI include machine learning and deep learning.</p>
      
      <p>Machine learning enables software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical 
        data as input to predict new output values. This approach became vastly more effective with the rise of large data sets to train on. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is based 
        on our understanding of how the brain is structured. Deep learning's use of artificial neural network structure is the underpinning of recent advances in AI, including self-driving cars and ChatGPT.</p>
